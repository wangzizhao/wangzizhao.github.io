I am a MS student in the computer science department at Columbia University. I am a member of [Columbia Robotics Lab](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/robotics/) advised by Professor [Peter Allen](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~allen/) and Pe'er Group advised by Professor [Itsik Pe'er](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~itsik/). My research interest focuses on Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic Graphical Models.

Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in computer engineering from University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, where I researched under the supervision of Professors [Gábor Orosz](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~orosz/) and [Necmiye Ozay](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/). As a dual-degree program student, I also received a B.S. in electrical and computer engineering at [University of Michigan – Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute](http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/about/).
